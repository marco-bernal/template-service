# Microservice Template

Used as a template for Spring Boot 3.3.5 and Java 22.

### Generic setup:
Important: Whenever copying a project from a mab template, make sure to delete the .git folder.
Then, update the code accordingly, create the remote repo and push the existing code to the remote repo:
* git remote add origin https://github.com/marco-bernal/my-remote-repo.git
* git branch -M master
* git push -u origin master

Finally, in the repo configure:
* Protect the master branch
* Ask for a PR to merge
* Remove branches automatically
